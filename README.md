In this project I used array methos `map()` to display each object by its details in the recipes data array. I also used map() a second time to display individual ingredients in each ingredients property array found in each recipe object.
For each ingredient list item, the key used is the ingredient itself; this way the key is unique and doesn't change after each rerender.
